## Description
OldOS is a reimagining of the past — a meticulous recreation of iOS as it existed over a decade ago, brought to life with today’s tools. Designed to capture the charm, simplicity, and elegance of the early iPhone era, OldOS merges nostalgia with functionality, creating a unique experience that feels both familiar and fresh.

Nearly every app in OldOS is fully operational. Whether you're listening to music in the classic iPod app, browsing the web in Safari, checking directions in Maps, or simply viewing the weather, the experience is seamless and immersive. Unlike a static simulator, OldOS connects with your actual data, providing a live and dynamic interface that mirrors how these apps once functioned — down to the pixel.

No shortcuts were taken in recreating the environment. Users can change wallpapers, access system settings, search through apps, and interact with a fully realized version of the classic OS. While a few apps are still in progress, they’re actively being developed and will be available soon.

What makes OldOS particularly special is its accessibility. There’s no need to hunt down a vintage iPhone — the entire experience runs on your current device. Whether you're here for the nostalgia or curious about the evolution of mobile design, OldOS offers a unique window into the past.

This project was created by zzanehip during his final months of high school. Beyond its nostalgic appeal, part of the vision behind OldOS was to provide an educational resource for other developers. Built entirely using SwiftUI, OldOS demonstrates what’s possible with modern frameworks, even when recreating legacy systems. That's why the project is open-source — to invite others to learn from, modify, and contribute to it.

OldOS is more than just a trip down memory lane. It’s a tool for learning, a showcase of design, and a labor of love from a developer passionate about the intersection of history and innovation.
